*Mati twitter bot*
------------------


_what it does ?_


by default botty tweet a "Bonjour monde !"
by default 


_okay and what else ?_



well ....
if you uncomment the function right after and set the topic variable to something you like (yes I like overwatch so what ? :p) it will listen to the tweets that have this word(s) in it :)

(to do so add `#` to lines 31 & 37)


--

and at last, on the last comemnt, botty harass poor journalists by liking their last 20 tweets
(and some dude added at the end of the list :* ) 


(add `#` to lines 41 & 64)

*WTF can't run your program and wtf are `arg_arr` ?*



Ah thanks for reading so far :3
indeed in order to make the botty work you need to insert your own keys 

you can do it when you run the program like this :


```rb botty.rb jxkjifwjefo-key1 kfldhfikqhw-key2 fkldsjfklwef-key3 jcwdljfijwaif-key4```

of course replace the keys here by your own consumer_key then consumer_secret_key then access_token then acess_token_secret 
exclusively in that order
