Mati twitter bot

what it does ?

by default botty harass poor journalists by liking their last 20 tweets
(and some dude added at the end of the list :* ) 


okay and what else ? 

well ....
if you uncomment the function right before and set the topic variable to something you like (yes I like overwatch so what ? :p) it will listen to the tweets that have this word(s) in it :)

(to do so add # to line 29 & 35)


WTF can't run your program and wtf are arg_arr ?

Ah thanks for reading so far :3
indeed in order to make the botty work you need to insert your own keys 

you can do it when you run the program like this :


rb botty.rb jxkjifwjefo-key1 kfldhfikqhw-key2 fkldsjfklwef-key3 jcwdljfijwaif-key4

of course replace the keys here by your own consumer_key then consumer_secret_key then access_token then acess_token_secret 
exclusively in that order


hope my english is understandable :p if you need more informations don't hesitate on sending a message on slack ;)
